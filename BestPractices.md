Use Git for version control
Organize models by layer: staging → intermediate → marts
Write tests for every model
Use tags for CI/CD (tags: ['daily'])
Document with description fields
Use macros for reusable logic
Use dbt build for full pipeline execution
Keep macros in macros/ folder with clear naming
Use comments and doc blocks for readability
Avoid overly complex logic — keep macros focused
Use dbt run-operation to test macros independently
